# How to install
* Download source files from github

* Rename folder to `levi-inventory`

# TO DO
you need to add a decay and created value in your qb-core/shared/items for all items, the decay is set to be the days the item lasts
<br>

```lua
-- created = this will get filled in with the time when it's created, just leave this
-- decay = amount of days that an item will decay
-- delete = choice whether to remove the item when it's decayed or not
["created"] = nil, ["decay"] = 28.0, ["delete"] = true
```
<br>
Example:
<br>

```lua
['sandwich'] = {['name'] = 'sandwich', ['label'] = 'Sandwich', ['weight'] = 200, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'sandwich.png', ['unique'] = false, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true,	['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Nice bread for your stomach', ["created"] = nil, ["decay"] = 3.0, ["delete"] = true},
```
In this example our sandwich will decay in 3 days and removed when used.
